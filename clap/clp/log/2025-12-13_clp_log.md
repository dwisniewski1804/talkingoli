# 2025-12-13 — CLP Log

## Summary
Today we worked on aligning the execution layer of the talkingoli project with the CLAP framework and fleshing out the next concrete ATP tasks.

We:
- Confirmed that `T1-product-skeleton-and-docker` is the first product task, scoped strictly to `/product` and **excluding CLAP from runtime**.
- Clarified the **task naming convention**: `T1-...`, `T2-...`, with optional `T1a` / `T1b` for parallel, non-conflicting tasks.
- Standardized the **ATP task template** (Goal, Scope, Out of Scope, Acceptance Criteria, Definition of Done, Notes).
- Designed and wrote detailed specs for follow-up tasks:
  - T2 — Developer Tooling & Code Quality Baseline  
  - T3 — Core Domain Model & Shared Contracts  
  - T4 — Web Routing & Layout Skeleton  
  - T5 — Logging, Error Handling & Basic Observability  
  - T6 — Local Demo Flow with Mocked Data (No AI)
- Ensured each task is expressed as a `.md` file ready to live under `clap/atp/tasks/d0/`.

## Notes
- Task IDs are the primary handles for agents; filenames mirror IDs: e.g. `T2-developer-tooling-and-code-quality-baseline.md`.
- Parallelization pattern: same number + letter (e.g. `T3a` / `T3b`) for tasks under one theme that can be done concurrently by different agents.
- CLAP remains a **framework/process layer only** and must not become a runtime dependency of the product.
- Connector/tooling limitations mean key ATP/CLP artifacts should be logged explicitly in the repo (and sometimes in chat) rather than assumed discoverable.
