# 2025-12-13 — T1 — Product Skeleton & Local Docker Environment

## Task
`task-0001`

## Outcome
- Created the full `/product` monorepo layout with `apps/api`, `apps/web`, `packages/shared`, and `infra/docker`.
- Implemented the NestJS API with `/health`, BullMQ queue worker, and Docker build/run scripts.
- Built the React + Vite frontend that polls the API and wired Docker to serve all services (API, web, Mongo, Redis, MinIO, Mailhog).
- Added React Router with a placeholder landing page plus a dedicated health page, refreshed styles, and ensured the frontend builds cleanly.
- Authored `.env.example`, README docs, service-specific READMEs, and ensured `docker-compose up --build` runs the entire stack locally.
- Renamed all runtime services/containers to the `talkingoli-*` prefix, updated compose/env files, and confirmed the stack rebuilds cleanly with the new naming.

## Notes
- Added `.env` locally and provided instructions for running `docker-compose` since the plugin isn’t available.
- Helped troubleshoot Docker install (apt key fixes) and addressed CORS + frontend base URL issues before finalizing the stack.
- Documented branch/commit conventions in development rules and created per-app READMEs for quick onboarding.
- Walked through Docker port conflicts, force-down operations, and introduced guidance for running dev mode inside containers vs. on the host.
