# Project Context — TalkingOli

TalkingOli is an AI-powered interview preparation platform.

Core ideas:
- Candidate uploads CV + job offer
- System calculates Match Rate
- Candidate completes interview stages (MVP: HRWomen)
- Voice-based interview using AI-generated questions
- Payment required after completing the first stage
- Results are delivered later by email (no immediate feedback)

Important constraints:
- No user accounts
- Email-based OTP authentication for data access
- Privacy-first (user can delete data anytime)
- MongoDB is used, but domain is modeled relationally
- Modular monolith, DDD-inspired architecture

You are implementing only what is explicitly described in tasks.
Do not invent product behavior.
